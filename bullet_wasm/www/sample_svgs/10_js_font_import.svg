        The Common Cormorant or shag
        Lays eggs inside a paper bag.
        The reason you will see no doubt
        It is to keep the lightning out.
        But what these unobservant birds
        Have never noticed is that herds
        Of wandering bears may come with buns
        And steal the bags to hold the crumbs.
